Basically an online memory game. Its details are much more complicated.

I have been developing this game for 7 months alone. The designs are made by a my friend. We both think and decide together the features to be added to the game. Basically an online memory game. Its details are much more complicated. There are many features where users collect cups-gold-skill cards-keys and try to reach various goals. It can be played online or offline. Some kind of simple artificial intelligence works in the offline part. There are 4 difficulty levels. There are maps with various features. Each map has a unique feature. There are many skill cards that affect the game. You can use these cards in your games if you can win. We have badges that reward the user as they achieve success. Also, these badges will show you how cool you are :). We shared the demo of the game with almost all the features with our close friends, but the development process is still ongoing.

We did not write maps story for now. First is default map. There is no feature for it. The ice map frozes some cards as step. User can not open these cards. The labyrinth map is so weird :) All cards shift one to the right each time users select a card. (if the card is on the far right of the screen, the card will slide down). One of the hardest maps we have ever created. It is so difficult to keep the moving cards in memory that we cannot finish the game :) We are considering reducing the number of cards for this map. We have some idea about other maps. But we did not start them yet. </figcaption>
