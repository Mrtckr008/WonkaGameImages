Basically an online memory game. Its details are much more complicated.

I have been developing this game for 7 months alone. The designs are made by a my friend. We both think and decide together the features to be added to the game. Basically an online memory game. Its details are much more complicated. There are many features where users collect cups-gold-skill cards-keys and try to reach various goals. It can be played online or offline. Some kind of simple artificial intelligence works in the offline part. There are 4 difficulty levels. There are maps with various features. Each map has a unique feature. There are many skill cards that affect the game. You can use these cards in your games if you can win. We have badges that reward the user as they achieve success. Also, these badges will show you how cool you are :). We shared the demo of the game with almost all the features with our close friends, but the development process is still ongoing.
